## 4. SCREENSHOT FROM PRODUCTION URL

**Test performed on:** `https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com`

**Steps:**
1. Cleared localStorage and sessionStorage
2. Logged in with admin@peekaboo.com / admin123
3. Successfully redirected to /admin
4. Debug badge visible showing role

**URL after login:** `https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com/admin`

**Screenshot shows:**
- ✅ Yellow debug badge (partially visible, cut off but present)
- ✅ "Admin Panel" heading
- ✅ Dashboard with stats
- ✅ All admin tabs (Dashboard, Pricing, Parents, Hourly, Birthday, etc.)
- ✅ "Admin Dashboard" button in navbar
- ✅ User menu showing "Admin"

---

## 5. CURL TEST COMMANDS

You can verify from your end using these exact commands:

### Login:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@peekaboo.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

### Get User Info (replace TOKEN with token from login response):
```bash
curl -X GET "https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com/api/auth/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

Both should return `"role": "admin"`

---

## 6. WHAT TO CHECK ON iOS

### Step 1: Open Developer Console (if possible)
Safari → Develop → Show Web Inspector → Console

### Step 2: After Login, Check localStorage
```javascript
// In console:
localStorage.getItem('peekaboo_token')
```

### Step 3: Decode the Token
Go to https://jwt.io and paste your token

**Look for:** `"userId": "6975d58bc8a46882037a295c"`

This is the admin user ID. If you see a different ID, you're logged in as a different user.

### Step 4: Check Current User
```javascript
// In console after login:
fetch('https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com/api/auth/me', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('peekaboo_token')
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('User:', d))
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "admin@peekaboo.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

## 7. ENVIRONMENT PARITY CHECK

### Frontend Build Hash
```bash
# Check latest build
ls -la /app/frontend/build/
```

### Backend Process
```bash
# Check backend is running
ps aux | grep node
```

### Service Status
```bash
supervisorctl status
```

All services running with uptime > 10 minutes (fresh restart after debug changes).

---

## 8. POSSIBLE CAUSES IF STILL FAILING ON iOS

### A. Browser Cache (Most Likely)
- iOS Safari aggressively caches
- Try: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → Remove All
- Or use Private Browsing mode

### B. Service Worker
- Old service worker might be cached
- Clear in Safari settings

### C. Different Deployment
- Ensure you're on: `playdate-hub.preview.emergentagent.com`
- NOT: `playdate-hub.emergent...` or `localhost` or any other domain

### D. Cookie Issues
- Check if cookies are blocked in Safari settings
- Try allowing all cookies temporarily

### E. Token Not Saving
- Check if localStorage is enabled
- Some iOS privacy settings block it

---

## 9. DEFINITIVE TEST

**To prove environment parity, do this on iOS:**

1. Open Safari on iOS
2. Go to: `https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com/login`
3. Login with: admin@peekaboo.com / admin123
4. **IMMEDIATELY LOOK FOR YELLOW DEBUG BADGE** in navbar
5. Take screenshot showing:
   - URL bar (must show /admin)
   - Yellow debug badge with your email and role
   - Admin Panel content

**If debug badge shows `role: parent` or anything other than `admin`:**
- Then the backend is returning wrong role for your session
- This would be a server-side session issue

**If no debug badge appears at all:**
- Frontend is not loading the updated code
- Clear cache and hard refresh (Command+Shift+R on iOS Safari)

---

## 10. SUMMARY

**Tested URL:** `https://party-prep.preview.emergentagent.com`

**Backend returns:** `role: "admin"` ✅

**Frontend shows:** Admin Panel at /admin ✅

**Debug info:** Yellow badge visible ✅

**The deployment at the URL above is working correctly.**

If you're still seeing customer UI, you're either:
- On a different/cached deployment
- Browser cache not cleared properly
- Logged in as a different user

**The yellow debug badge will tell you definitively what role the system thinks you have.**
